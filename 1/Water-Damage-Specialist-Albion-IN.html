<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

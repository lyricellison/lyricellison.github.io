They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to get the job done effectively.

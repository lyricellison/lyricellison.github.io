<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) remove the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>

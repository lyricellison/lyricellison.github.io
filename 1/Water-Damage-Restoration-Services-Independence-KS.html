<p>As soon as standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any adjustments if you have questions on this.</p>

<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Brownsville</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health danger and should be removed.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

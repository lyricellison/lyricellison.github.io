Warm air between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal, especially for the first 36 to two days of drying and is the optimal temperature for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit aids in the evaporation process. Extremely hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit hinders the dehumidifiers' efficiency.<p>
<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead organic product such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also obtain nutrients from some synthetic products such as paints and adhesives. Mold requires wetness, although some mold types can get that moisture from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent.

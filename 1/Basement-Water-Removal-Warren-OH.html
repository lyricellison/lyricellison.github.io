<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>

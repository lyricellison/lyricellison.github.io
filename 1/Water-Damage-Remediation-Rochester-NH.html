<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve searching a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

<p>Getting it damp can turn into a major headache due to the fact that the plaster drywall is soluble and permeable in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get wet and just starts to sag prior to drying out, repairing it might just require pushing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

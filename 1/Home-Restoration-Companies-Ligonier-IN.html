<p>Even when you contain a small indoor fire, smoke damage can happen. That's because fire is a visible combustion of light and heat, and many people understand how to consist of a fire. Therefore, people will work to include a fire without focusing on smoke damage prevention. Smoke is slightly harder to see than the fire itself and seems less threatening. Also, because it's in the air, it's almost difficult to consist of. Even after a fire is dispatched, smoke in the air can cause damage. Smoke damage restoration services are typically required to restore damage left behind from small indoor fires.</p>

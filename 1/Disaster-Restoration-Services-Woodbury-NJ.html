<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly hassle-free. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth learning. Once the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area.

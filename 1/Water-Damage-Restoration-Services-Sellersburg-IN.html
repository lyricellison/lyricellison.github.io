<p>The area that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can easily take a trip as soon as they are interrupted. Air filtering systems are usually utilized in conjunction with the sealing of the location to get rid of as lots of airborne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the area includes using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, as well as unfavorable atmospheric pressure, which prevents the circulation of air in between the infected area and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be switched off to avoid the mold from spreading also.</p>

<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke stains. This stage is necessary, as these sponges utilize special chemicals to lift stains from walls. Never use soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread the soot and make it impossible to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Begin cleaning the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always utilizing a clean surface area. When all sides are soiled, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas below. Or just get a new sponge. Ensure you utilize a cleaning motion the whole time. You may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area if you scrub the stains.</p>

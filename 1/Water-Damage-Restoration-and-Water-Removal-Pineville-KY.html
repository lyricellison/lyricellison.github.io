<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

<h3>Affordable Fire Restoration in Bonita</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and must be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>

Mold spores thrive on moisture. Mold spores can quickly grow into nests when exposed to water. These colonies might produce irritants and allergens.<p>

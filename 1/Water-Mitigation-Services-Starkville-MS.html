<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the same method, so if the place the spores land is great and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Remove the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and eliminate the battery immediately. Getting rid of the battery quickly could make the difference to save your phone.

You can try to draw the moisture out by submerging the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent product over night. You can also attempt to dry it out with a vacuum cleaner, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too close to the gadget. In some cases cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water very long.</p>

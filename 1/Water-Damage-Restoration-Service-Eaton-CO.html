Examples of Classification 3 water can include, but are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap despite visible content or color; all kinds of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and rising water from streams or rivers; and other contaminated water entering or impacting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from cyclones, hurricanes, or other weather associated events.

<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is an extreme, destructive chemical.

For these reasons try to prevent using bleach and if you need to utilize it, only use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>

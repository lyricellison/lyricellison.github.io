Examples of Classification 3 water can include, but are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap despite visible content or color; all kinds of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and rising water from streams or rivers; and other contaminated water entering or impacting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from cyclones, hurricanes, or other weather associated events.

<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is an extreme, destructive chemical.

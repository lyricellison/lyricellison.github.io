<p>Flooding can trigger severe damage to a commercial building.

The mold grows finest when there is lots of moisture from a leaking roofing, high humidity, or flood. There is no way to get rid of all molds and mold spores from your home. But you can control mold growth by keeping your home dry.<p>

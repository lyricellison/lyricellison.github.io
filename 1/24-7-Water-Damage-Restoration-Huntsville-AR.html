<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, but it can take place by itself if a fire is contained. It is your responsibility to pay the deductible if you make a claim with your provider. It is traditional for restoration contractors to gather the deductible in advance when work is to start, and we will inform your insurance company in such circumstances. Other times, your deductible might be subtracted" from the last insurance check, in which case you would pay the deductible amount at the end of the job.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>

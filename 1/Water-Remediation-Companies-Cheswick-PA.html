<p>Due to the fact that the plaster drywall is soluble and permeable in water, getting it damp can turn into a significant headache. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get wet and just starts to droop before drying out, fixing it may simply need pressing it back into place, securing it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

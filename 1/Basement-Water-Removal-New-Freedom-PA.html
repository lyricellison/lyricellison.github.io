<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or company is among the most destructive things that can occur to a person or a family. When your home is damaged by water, you wish to clean it quickly and ensure it does not happen again. After all, your home is your safe house, you don't want it contaminated by contaminants, mold, and bacteria from flood water. To fix water damage in your house you need to determine the source, clear the standing water, dehumidify the remaining moisture, clean and sanitize all affected areas, and repair and restore any damage to floor covering, walls, or other locations.</p>
<p>Because common structure materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

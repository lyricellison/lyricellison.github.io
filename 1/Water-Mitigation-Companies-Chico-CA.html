<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his guys were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to your house and started drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were really helpful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>

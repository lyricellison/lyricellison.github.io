<p>When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. It can be a permanent health hazard and ought to be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, duct work and electrical wiring.</p>

These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>

<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly devastating. As soon as InstaScope was produced, we engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide recognized expert on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was designated to validate and test the new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to create a new mold-assessment system for business clients that, unlike any other method or gadget, can deliver clinically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly. So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>

Many phones have a white sign near the battery that will turn pink or red if water has damaged the gadget. You can try to draw the moisture out by submerging the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent material over night.

Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material ought to be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>

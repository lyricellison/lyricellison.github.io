<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job appropriately.

<p>Utilize a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, since it might unintentionally press liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. You might attempt vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to draw more water out if the phone was totally submerged. Once the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Correct cleanup after mold removal is vital to prevent recontamination. You should seal and immediately get rid of products that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the shoes or boots you used while cleaning, clean your clothing in hot water, and shower to remove spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>

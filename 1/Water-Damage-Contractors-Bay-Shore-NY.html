<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Our experience with RestorePro was wonderful. I would 100% recommend calling them for aid. As soon as we found our water leak upstairs their mitigation group was here in no time (on a Friday night). Phillip was professional, friendly and helped me understand the process of what would be happening to fix and repair our home. I could tell each and every employee I met was selected since of their professionalism and attention to detail. The finished item was beyond our expectations. I'm truly picky about the work that is carried out in my home, see all the details and was impressed with the completed result. Their group dealt with easily with our insurance. When I informed my representative who we called she said Oh, you remain in good hands, they're fantastic!" I could not agree more. Thank you for the work you performed in our home. If you are trying to find an expert, relaiable and quality restoration company, call RestorePro.</p>

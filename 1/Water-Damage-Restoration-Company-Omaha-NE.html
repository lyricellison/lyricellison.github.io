<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on walls and floors is another prospective impact of water damage. Walls and flooring may need replacement or refinishing depending upon the level of damage. Musty odors can linger in a home where leaks or flooding have occurred and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

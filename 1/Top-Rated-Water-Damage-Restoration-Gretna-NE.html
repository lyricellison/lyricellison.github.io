<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up. Desiccant dehumidifiers work when damp incoming air streams over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant. This process soaks up wetness without ice accumulation and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can easily run below freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Between extraction and drying, there is substantial work to do to recover a home after storm losses. This obstacle is a lot more substantial when structural damages are plentiful. With our basic contracting services that we offer, we can effortlessly transition between mitigation and construct back, and use these very same specialists to aid with regulated demolition to improve the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of restoration.</p>

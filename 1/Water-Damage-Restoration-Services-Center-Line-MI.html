Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on walls and floors is another potential result of water damage. Walls and floor covering may require replacement or refinishing depending on the level of damage. Moldy odors can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have actually happened and this could be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was basic: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that lawyers now allege came from pressure to develop much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little government and home builder oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical yearly rains is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>

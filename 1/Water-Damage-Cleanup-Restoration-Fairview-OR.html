Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy development on furniture or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>A pipe burst in my crawlspace, triggering major water build-up.

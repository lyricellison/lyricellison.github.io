Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season.

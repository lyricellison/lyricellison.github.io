The dew point is the temperature level the air needs to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas kind. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid form if the air were to be cooled even more. The higher the humidity rises, the higher the amount of moisture in the air.</p>

Protection for surface area water intrusion to the dwelling would generally require a separate flood insurance policy.</p>

<p>Beginning water damage cleanup as quickly as possible is important due to the fact that water can be taken in by permeable products, including wood and sheetrock, or seep under the foundation of floorings.

<p>Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level.

<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I discovered First Action online, and they were out within the hour. It was a harsh experience, however whatever they did for me was excellent. When they were providing me problems, they best thing about First Response was that they were able to handle my insurance company. This probably helped me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and dealt with the problem for me, which was a substantial relief. They were very expert, and I liked everyone I handled from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repair work were dealt with to my fulfillment. I would utilize them again.<p>

<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground.

Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is great and damp, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>

You'll want to get rid of mold from the outside of your house, on siding or on your deck, as soon as possible. External mold can do significant damage to exterior surface areas in time, gnawing at wood, stucco and other products. In addition, exterior mold can quickly work its method into the house if left unattended.<p>
<p>Basements are the lowest point in a home and for that reason tend to flood first throughout a water emergency. When the unanticipated happens, we're on site within 2-4 hours to restore your home as rapidly as possible. With rapid action, your floorings, walls, and personal effects can frequently be restored. In case of unknown water damage, many homeowners aren't able to avoid mold growth. A tiny leak in the roofing or pipes can continue for months before you notice it.

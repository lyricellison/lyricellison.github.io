<p>When standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes.</p>
<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition.

Other products may simply require to be sanitized and relocated to high ground. Soft items like clothes, bedspreads, drapes can be sent out to a laundry service that we can arrange for you. Another point is, there are various levels of contamination with water (see Categories of Water), which will factor into the equation of what can be conserved and what must be replaced.

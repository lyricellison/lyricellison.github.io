<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repair work. By minimizing the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet.

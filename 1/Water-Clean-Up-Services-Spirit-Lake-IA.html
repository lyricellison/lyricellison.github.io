<p>Flooding can cause serious damage to an industrial structure. Whether it's caused by heavy rain, overruning waterways, or damaged plumbing, the water needs to be removed and the building's contents need to be rapidly dried to avoid structural damage, mold development, and other issues. The mold grows best when there is lots of moisture from a leaky roofing system, high humidity, or flood. There is no other way to eliminate all molds and mold spores from your home. But you can manage mold development by keeping your home dry.<p>

Prior to you start a task like this, provide the water damaged location a great clean. This is the book first step in any paint project, including repairing water damage on walls.

<p>Any building that has actually struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on floorings and walls is another potential result of water damage. Walls and floor covering may require replacement or refinishing depending upon the level of damage. Musty smells can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have occurred and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

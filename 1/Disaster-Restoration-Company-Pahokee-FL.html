<h3>Fire And Water Restoration in Pahokee</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and must be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>

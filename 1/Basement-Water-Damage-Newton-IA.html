Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to do the job effectively.

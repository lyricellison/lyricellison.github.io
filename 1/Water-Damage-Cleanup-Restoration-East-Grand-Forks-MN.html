<p>If smoke and fire damage has affected your possessions, we will deal with you and your insurer to determine what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For items that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged possessions. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which penetrates into permeable surface, avoiding water from leaking back through. Basically, it makes the location strong again and safeguards the surface from future water damage. After you have actually applied the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
<p>Molds thrive in moist environments created by a flood, slow leakage, broken pipeline or simply high humidity. Without water mold, can not grow. Mold also needs a food source, oxygen and a temperature between 40 degrees and 100 degrees F. Usually, a minimum of 4 air movers per space is required. to properly dry the structure. Air movement has been proven to increase the drying rate. The quantity of air movers used on the website will be identified by one of our licensed service technicians who will utilize the IICRC standard.<p>

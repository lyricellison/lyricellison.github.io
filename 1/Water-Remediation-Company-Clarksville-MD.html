Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

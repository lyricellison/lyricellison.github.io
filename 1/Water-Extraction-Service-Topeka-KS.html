<p>Recent Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done appropriately. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Notification that your home is flooded? Do not lose time, and call a professional immediately.

Call a water damage restoration company that can totally evaluate the extent of the damage, and can provide the very best strategy. Don't even think about taking a hair dryer to your handset.

If you can get rid of the back panel of your phone, utilize a cloth to clean down the parts inside.<p>

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying given that the leak began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous individual.</p>

<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Auburn</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health hazard and must be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

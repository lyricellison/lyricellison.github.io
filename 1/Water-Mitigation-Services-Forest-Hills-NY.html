<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction in between the oxygen that is present in the environment and a source of flammable fuel. Once this combustible fuel - carpet, furniture, or drywall - has actually been heated up to its distinct ignition temperature level, the fuel will ignite and volatile gases will be released in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause long lasting damage and should be handled by experienced professionals, heat is the most obvious, and destructive, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire enters contact with additional fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>First things first - prepare what you require Generally, you require a dependable product in cleaning mold. Lots of home owners believe that bleach is a reliable mold treatment. However contrary to the popular view, it isn't. Bleach is a strong chemical which can harm your health. Also, it does not get rid of the mold. It only changes its color from black to white or grey. After a few weeks of whitening, there is still a huge possibility that the mold will return.</p>

<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Amongst the items we utilize to deal with mold problems is the resurfacing agent Microbe Guard, which produces a new, permanent layer over a surface. By resisting microbial assaults, the brand-new surface can seal out mold, giving it no opportunity to grow. But Microorganism Guard is simply one aspect of our well-rounded services. A foundation of our approach to mold remediation is extensive prevention that blocks the regrowth of harmful mold. Individuals building a brand-new home or structure will discover our prevention methods especially important.</p>

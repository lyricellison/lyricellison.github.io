Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag before drying, repairing it might just require pushing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous person.</p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were really happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>

Rely on ServiceMaster of Chesapeake for skilled guidance and the experience to fix your water or flood damage quick. Warm air in between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is perfect, particularly for the first 36 to 2 days of drying and is the optimal temperature level for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit aids in the evaporation process. Excessively hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit restrains the dehumidifiers' efficiency.<p>

<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier since it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Utilizing paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth learning. Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the professional will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation process is considered to complete.<p>

<p>In the course of a remediation, we occasionally advise disposing of certain types of surface areas and objects. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical products in need of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup process, which likewise includes vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or minor particles neglected in the remediation process. An unique HEPA vacuum ensures that even small particles get collected to decrease the chances of the mold moving in other places. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold.

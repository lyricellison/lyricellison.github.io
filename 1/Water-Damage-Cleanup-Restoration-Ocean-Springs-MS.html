<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and must be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>

Printable variations of these and other guidance files are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the moldy material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be needed.<p>

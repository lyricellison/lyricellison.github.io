<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>It's a stressful scenario when water floods your floors, soaks into your walls, and damages your furniture. Given that a carpet cleaner can just do so much, you require a water damage cleanup group that does it all. Desiccants (silica gel, clay, calcium oxide) absorb moisture like a sponge. Place water-permeable packages of desiccants and wet items in airtight containers or in sealed locations, like closets. Some desiccants alter color to show they are saturated, which can take weeks or days, depending upon how much moisture items include.<p>

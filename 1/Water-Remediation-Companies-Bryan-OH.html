<p>Keep in mind: While most experts recommend a relative humidity of less than 60%, below 50% is best for controlling both mold development and dust mites. Dust mites are tiny animals associated with spiders, ticks and other termites. Dust mites consume mold and dead human or animal skin scales (flakes) and leave allergenic proteins. Allergen minimize irritant production at these lower humidity levels. Stop toilet texting - Browsing sessions and texting rallies constantly appear more urgent than they truly are.

<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and beneficial temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead organic material such as wood, paper or materials; mold can also obtain nutrients from some synthetic products such as adhesives and paints.

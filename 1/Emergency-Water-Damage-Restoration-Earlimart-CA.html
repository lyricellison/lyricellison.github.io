Utilizing bleach on these products will kill the mold above the surface area but the roots within the product will remain and the mold will soon return.</p>
<p>When standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature level too, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any modifications.</p>

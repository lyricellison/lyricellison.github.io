<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of home damage that a family or company can experience. Once MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight.</p>

<p>Learn how to eliminate black mold safely and efficiently. Category 3 - Classification 3 water is grossly infected and can consist of pathogenic, toxigenic, or other harmful agents. Examples of Category 3 water can consist of, but are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that stem from beyond the toilet trap despite visible material or color; all types of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and increasing water from rivers or streams; and other contaminated water going into or impacting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from typhoons, tropical storms, or other weather condition related events. Such water sources might carry silt, raw material, pesticides, heavy metals, managed products, or harmful organic compounds.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>

<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier because it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape.

When the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation process is considered to complete.<p>

<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this indicates that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will include browsing a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

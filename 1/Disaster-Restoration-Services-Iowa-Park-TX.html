<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals think that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread out, harming a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve searching a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

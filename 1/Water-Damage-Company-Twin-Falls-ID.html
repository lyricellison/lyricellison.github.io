Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or droop under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous plaster product.

<p>An insurance plan may or might not cover the costs associated with water damage and the process of water damage restoration.

Frequently the terminology of this addendum resembles "Sewer and Drain Coverage".</p>

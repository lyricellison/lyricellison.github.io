There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air.

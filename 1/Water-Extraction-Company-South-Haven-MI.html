Hydrogen peroxide is a great option to chlorine bleach since it is safe to utilize and does not damage the environment, nor does it leave harmful residue or produce poisonous fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can purchase hydrogen peroxide from drug shops for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>

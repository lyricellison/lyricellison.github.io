Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has affected sprawling suburban houses, starter homes, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike.

Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Significant smoke damage can leave your residential or commercial property charred and tarnished. It can stain walls and ceilings yellow and warp wood and plastic.

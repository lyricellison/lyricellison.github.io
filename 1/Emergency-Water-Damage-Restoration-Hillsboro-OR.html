Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.

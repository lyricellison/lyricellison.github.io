<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Among the items we utilize to resolve mold concerns is the resurfacing agent Microbe Guard, which develops a brand-new, long-term layer over a surface area.

A cornerstone of our approach to mold remediation is comprehensive avoidance that obstructs the regrowth of damaging mold. People constructing a new home or structure will discover our prevention techniques particularly important.</p>

<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many individuals think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider area than the fire itself.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp.

Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have actually ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Any structure that has suffered from water damage or problems with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Use a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore protection, and cover hands, legs and arms to avoid contact with mold spores. Usage soap and a sponge to eliminate noticeable mold. If the moldy area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will lower the incidence of airborne mold spores during cleaning. Next, use commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in many hardware or home repair stores, to decontaminate the moldy areas, in addition to any adjacent areas. If you utilize bleach, make sure it will not tarnish the material or surface area. Place all sponges, equipment and other products used in cleaning in a heavy duty trash can, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a close-by exit instead of the main home, to avoid dispersing mold spores.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a harsh, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach also produces severe fumes and it even produces toxic gas when combined with ammonia. There are much safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which do not produce dangerous fumes or leave toxic residue. For these factors attempt to avoid using bleach and if you need to utilize it, just use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>

Condensation in the location between the attic and your home can cause wetness on the underside of the roofing, which can cause mold and decomposing.

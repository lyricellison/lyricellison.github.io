<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always practical. Using paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth finding out. Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation process is considered to complete.<p>

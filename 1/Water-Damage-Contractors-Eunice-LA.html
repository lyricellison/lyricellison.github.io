Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he discovered just how much water costs I was paying considering that the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really courteous individual.</p>

<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Severn</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health risk and should be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>After the flood waters recede and the tidy up has actually been done, most folks want to return into their services or houses and start reconstructing. The issue is that wood that has been immersed in water has actually likely soaked up a large quantity of water. Reconstructing too rapidly after a flood can cause continuing problems such as mold growth, insect invasions, and deterioration of the wood and wall coverings.<p>

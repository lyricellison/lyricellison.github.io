<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to keep the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year.

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor removed. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of a number of days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>

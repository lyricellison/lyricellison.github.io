<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health threat and need to be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying.

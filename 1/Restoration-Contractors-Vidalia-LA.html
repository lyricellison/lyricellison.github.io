<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is an extreme, destructive chemical. When blended with ammonia, chlorine bleach also gives off harsh fumes and it even produces toxic gas. There are safer options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce hazardous fumes or leave behind poisonous residue. For these reasons try to prevent utilizing bleach and if you need to use it, just utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>

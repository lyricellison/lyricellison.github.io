What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mold developments (nests) can establish within 24-48 hours, so it is necessary to act instantly if you have a water spill or leakage-- especially if you live in a hot or humid  environment.

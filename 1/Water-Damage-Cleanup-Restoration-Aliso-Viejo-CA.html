<h2>Tips For Effective Water Damage Restoration in Aliso Viejo</h2>

<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, try to preserve the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can buy devices to determine relative humidity at some home supply shops. Ventilation, air circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to minimize the production of wetness in the home are all really important in managing high humidity that often triggers mold growth in our climate.</p>

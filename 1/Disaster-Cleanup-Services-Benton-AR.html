If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and must be eliminated.

This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

Before mold lies, you may smell an unique musty scent or experience allergic reaction symptoms due to mold direct exposure. These odors are especially pungent in areas like the basement. The foul smell resembles the aroma of damp, mildewy laundry. Unfortunately, it's not unusual for homeowners to error mold growth for dirt.</p>

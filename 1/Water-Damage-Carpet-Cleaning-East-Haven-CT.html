<p>Due to the fact that typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

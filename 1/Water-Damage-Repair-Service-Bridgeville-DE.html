<p>Flooding of a private sewage system can be a hazardous scenario for house owners, according to Plumbing 2.0's seasoned plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, infected drinking water and lack of sanitation until the system is repaired.

When the soil is filled or flooded, those harmful materials can get in the groundwater and your drinking supply of water.</p>

To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the service on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall.

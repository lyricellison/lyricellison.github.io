Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he discovered how much water expense I was paying considering that the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Very respectful and easy-going individual.</p>

<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical. Chlorine bleach also gives off extreme fumes and it even produces poisonous gas when mixed with ammonia. There are safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce unsafe fumes or leave toxic residue. For these reasons try to avoid utilizing bleach and if you must utilize it, only utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>

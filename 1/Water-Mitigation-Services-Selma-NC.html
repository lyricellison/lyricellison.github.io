<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and pour over afflicted location. Let it sit for five minutes, and after that clean it away with a wet towel. Similar to some of the above methods, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the issue zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest step in the process is restoration. Restoration includes replacing products like drywall and insulation.

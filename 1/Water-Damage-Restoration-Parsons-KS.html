<p>As a naturally taking place and prevalent substance in our world, mold exists in a variety of different kinds-- many of which are non-toxic and primarily impact those with allergic reactions and asthma.

There are over 100,000 types of species of mold, however the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days.

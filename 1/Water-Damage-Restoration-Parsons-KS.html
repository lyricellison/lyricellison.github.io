<p>As a naturally taking place and prevalent substance in our world, mold exists in a variety of different kinds-- many of which are non-toxic and primarily impact those with allergic reactions and asthma.

<p>The greatest aspect that can be removed is the moisture that mold requires to cultivate. There are over 100,000 types of species of mold, however the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days.

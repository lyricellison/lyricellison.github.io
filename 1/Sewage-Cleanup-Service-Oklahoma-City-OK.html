<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. An automatic shut-off valve is exceptional insurance to have in any circumstance, especially when the water heater unit is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your water heater looms unless fixed rapidly, and the costs go up the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The offender might have been something as simple as a pressure relief valve requiring replacing or something devastating like a tank failure.</p>
<p>If a pipe in your home has actually dripped for months and gone without repair work, mold can grow as an outcome, however it will not be covered by your property owners insurance. Given that floods can also cause mold, any possible mold that grows as an outcome of a flood would be covered by flood insurance, if you have it. Ought to you send a claim for mold damage, this cause would be evaluated and figured out by the flood insurance coverage adjuster.</p>

<p>As the task advances and the environment is stabilized, products can be dried by managing the air flow, humidity, and energy (heat). Further into the drying, air motion should be re-directed and guarantee excellent transfer of energy to the remaining damp areas. The general need for humidity control and airflow can be lower than at the start of the project given that there is considerably less moisture in materials being vaporized throughout the latter phase.</p>

There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my main water valve.

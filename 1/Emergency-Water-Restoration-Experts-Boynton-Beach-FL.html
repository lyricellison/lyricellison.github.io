They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were very pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.

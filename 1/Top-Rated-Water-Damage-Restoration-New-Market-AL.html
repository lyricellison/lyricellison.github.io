<h2>Water Damage Restoration, What All New Market Home Owners Need To Know</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As mentioned, quick air movement throughout wet surface areas of materials or assemblies is an important part of efficiently and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Fast air motion throughout the surface of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface moisture gives way to decreasing moisture material in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying products require various requirements for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>

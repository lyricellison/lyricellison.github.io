<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, however it can occur on its own if a fire is contained. If you make a claim with your carrier, it is your responsibility to pay the deductible. It is customary for restoration contractors to collect the deductible up front when work is to start, and we will notify your insurance provider in such instances. Other times, your deductible might be deducted" from the last insurance coverage check, in which case you would pay the deductible amount at the end of the job. Another possibility is that your insurance carrier take the deductible quantity off of the amount they owe you for your personal contents. In all these cases, you ultimately pay your deductible, either to Flagship or in another way.</p>

Dark, damp crawl spaces can be a sanctuary for mold and mildew, which is turn can then trigger structural damage as they grow. If there is wetness leaking through it, the concrete foundation of your home can trigger dripping in the basement. Condensation in the area in between the attic and your home can trigger moisture on the underside of the roof, which can cause mold and decomposing. When examining your home for prospective reasons for water damage be sure to keep an eye out for wetness in light fixtures in addition to the overall condition of any obvious piping.</p>

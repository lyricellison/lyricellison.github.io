<p>Check damaged materials for mold and mildew Mold can begin to grow in the ideal conditions in as low as 24 hours. For long-term concerns, like mold caused by attic condensation, the mold might have begun growing a long period of time earlier. And if you discover mold and mildew issues, you need to be very mindful. Some mold is poisonous to people, and all mold is extremely damaging to the products it infests. For small mold issues, eliminated the product, bag it, and toss it away immediately. For serious mold problems, leave the area, shut down any airflow (to avoid spore contamination) and call an expert. And remember that mold can show up in concealed areas like inside walls or under floorings, so this examination and water damage repair will be ongoing.</p>

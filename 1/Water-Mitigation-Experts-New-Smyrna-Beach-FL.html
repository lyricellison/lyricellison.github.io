<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Try to find noticeable mold development (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find signs of wetness or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water spots, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>As you can see, the longer the water remains in the materials, the more risk is included, the more materials need to be removed and the more odor is developed.

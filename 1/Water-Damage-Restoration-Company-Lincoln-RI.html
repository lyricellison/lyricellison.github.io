<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or business is one of the most disastrous things that can happen to a person or a household. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired rather than being completely changed. If there is minor damage then most of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might require fixing. Nevertheless, if the damage is major then the entire floor might require replacing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The type of wood flooring you may have figures out and limits the type of repair work that require to happen. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a broader series of choices to fix the problem. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This type of flooring can also have replacements for individual planks. The best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>

Drying might need special methods, longer drying times, or considerable water vapor pressure differentials.</p>

<p>When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Remove paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level.

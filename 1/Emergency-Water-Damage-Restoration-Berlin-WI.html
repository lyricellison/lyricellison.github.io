<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier because it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always hassle-free. Using paper tape requires some practice and little skill, but it's well worth discovering. Once the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the service technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation process is considered to finish.<p>

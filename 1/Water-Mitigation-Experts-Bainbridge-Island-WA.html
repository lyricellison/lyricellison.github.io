Long-term staining on walls and floors is another potential effect of water damage. Walls and flooring might require replacement or refinishing depending on the extent of damage. Moldy odors can remain in a home where leaks or flooding have happened and this could be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>The very best remediation is done by a mold assessor who validates the presence of a mold problem requiring action and the extent of damage then writes a clear scope of work consisting of suitable requirements.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, duct work and circuitry.</p>

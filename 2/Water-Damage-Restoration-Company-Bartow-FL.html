<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely damaging. Jake and his men were incredible in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were very valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>

What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

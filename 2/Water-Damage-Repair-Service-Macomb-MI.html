In some cases, wooden sheathing is so saturated that it now flakes quickly, crumbling into mulch-like chips. Mold, termites, and phorid flies have plagued some walls.</p>
<p>More involved screening might involve sending out samples to a screening facility, or taking samples of the air to evaluate if there is no noticeable mold, but mold is suspected.

By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is essential to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this assists reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>

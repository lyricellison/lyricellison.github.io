<h3>Water Damage In House in Grand Haven Michigan</h2>
<p>Mold can be found almost anywhere you turn. They grow on practically any organic substance as long as moisture and oxygen are present. Mold can grow on wood, paper, carpet, foods, and insulation. When excessive wetness builds up in your house or office mold development will frequently take place, particularly if the wetness issue stays undiscovered or unaddressed. It is difficult to eliminate all mold and mold spores, but it can be controlled.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate up to 18 inches of drywall due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a major health risk. However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>

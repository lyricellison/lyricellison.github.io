<p>When you're eliminating the damaged area, it's a great concept to cut it out as a rectangle or square While this usually increases the quantity of area you require to replace, this makes it easier to cut and fit patches.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he learnt how much water costs I was paying since the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really respectful person.</p>

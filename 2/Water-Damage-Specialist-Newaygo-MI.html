<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Newaygo</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health risk and must be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>

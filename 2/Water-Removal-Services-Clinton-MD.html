<p>Rust is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the gradual and sluggish deterioration of products (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you integrate electrical power, water, metal and oxygen, producing iron oxide (or what is more frequently called rust). There is no dependable timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components typically begin wearing away right away after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without revealing any obvious sign of an issue. How fast the rust process takes depends on a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can attend to the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration caused by a water spill.</p>

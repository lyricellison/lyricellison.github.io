<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier since it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers choose paper tape.

Fans will blow air across the surface and trigger the water to evaporate, then the dehumidifiers will draw it out of the air and drain it so that it won't kick back into the product and cause more damage to the space.<p>

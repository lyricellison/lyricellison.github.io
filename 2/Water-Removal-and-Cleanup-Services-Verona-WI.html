<p>Test garments before using any treatment, and follow the maker's directions. Smoke odor and soot can often be cleaned from clothing that can be bleached. Procedure 4 to 6 tbsp. Tri-Sodium Phosphate and 1 cup family cleaner or chlorine bleach for each gallon of warm water you will use.

<p>To avoid mold in the basement, you need to change the conditions that can trigger it to grow. Initially, get rid of dampness by installing a dehumidifier and ensuring the dryer vent exhausts externally, if you utilize your basement for laundry.

<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold professionals usually suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the service on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush till the mold disappears. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly.

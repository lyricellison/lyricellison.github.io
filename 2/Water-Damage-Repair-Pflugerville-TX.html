<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread out, harming a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve searching a wide area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

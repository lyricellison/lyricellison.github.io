Extreme rain can over fill the ground, leading to leakages, frozen pipeline water damage, and even fractures throughout the basement. Basements are the lowest point in a home and tend to flood initially during any sort of water damage emergency.

There are over 100,000 types of types of mold, however the most common kinds of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is damp and warm, it starts to sprout and colonize within 24-48 hours.

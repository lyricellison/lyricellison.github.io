<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of property damage that a family or service can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process.

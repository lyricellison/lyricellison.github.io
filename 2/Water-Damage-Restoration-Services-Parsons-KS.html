It is the slow and progressive deterioration of products (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration occurs when you integrate electricity, water, metal and oxygen, developing iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no reputable schedule for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal components generally begin corroding instantly after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can work typically for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of an issue. How fast the corrosion process takes depends on a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid.

<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

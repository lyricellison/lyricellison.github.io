<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke spots. This phase is essential, as these sponges utilize special chemicals to lift stains from walls. Never ever utilize soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread out the soot and make it difficult to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Start wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly utilizing a clean surface area. When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas underneath. Or just get a new sponge. Ensure you use a cleaning movement the whole time. If you scrub the spots, you might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area.</p>

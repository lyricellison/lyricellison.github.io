<p>Any building that has actually struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Wear a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore security, and cover arms, hands and legs to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove visible mold. If the moldy location is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will reduce the occurrence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in most hardware or home repair stores, to decontaminate the moldy locations, in addition to any nearby locations. Make sure it will not discolor the material or surface area if you use bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other materials utilized in cleaning in a sturdy garbage bag, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a close-by exit instead of the main house, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>

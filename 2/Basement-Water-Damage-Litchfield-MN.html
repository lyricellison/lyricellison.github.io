<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Litchfield</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health risk and must be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>

To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the option on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall.

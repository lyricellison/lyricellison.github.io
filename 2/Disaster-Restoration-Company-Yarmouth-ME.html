<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a severe, destructive chemical. When mixed with ammonia, chlorine bleach also provides off harsh fumes and it even produces harmful gas. There are much safer options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce unsafe fumes or leave hazardous residue. For these factors try to prevent using bleach and if you need to use it, just utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>

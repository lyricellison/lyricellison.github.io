Once MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really pricey paperweight.</p>

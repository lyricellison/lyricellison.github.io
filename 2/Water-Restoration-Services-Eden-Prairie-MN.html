<p>When you are planning large repairs, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is finished, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>

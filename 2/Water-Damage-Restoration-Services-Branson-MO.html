<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Branson</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health threat and should be eliminated if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>Because mold thrives in wetness, any sources of water, humidity, or wetness need to be addressed and completely dried prior to mold remediation can start. Otherwise, while the noticeable mold may be removed, the tiny spores could just recolonize the location within a few days. No matter how a fire begins or where it spreads out, the effects can be ravaging. Once the fire is out, you're left with picking up the pieces, however you do not need to do it alone. Topaz's restoration professionals are geared up with the training and tools to restore your home or office to it's pre-fire condition.<p>

The very best method to prevent mold development is to remove water leakages or moisture in your home. See our post, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold prevention suggestions.</p>
<p>Since the gypsum drywall is permeable and soluble in water, getting it wet can turn into a major headache.

In the case where drywall does get wet and just begins to sag before drying, fixing it might simply require pressing it back into location, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

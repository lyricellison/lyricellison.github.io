<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is good and wet, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>

Basic household fans are not capable of moving an appropriate quantity of air needed to dry a space sufficiently.</p>

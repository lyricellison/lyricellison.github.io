<h3>Water Mitigation Process in Springfield Georgia</h2>

Rainbow came out to the house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action necessary to avoid more damage burning the midnight oil into the night. They also completed the whole dry which took several days and a lot of effort. Always arrived on time and did what they promised and kept me informed of each step. It was an enjoyment to deal with the entire team. I would not think twice to recommend them for any work of this nature consisting of mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a major health risk. However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the area you're repairing so that you know just how much new wallboard you need. If you require custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a spot to fit, utilizing an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your brand-new panel with the wall studs and then protect the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power driver. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel satisfies. Then apply joint compound over the tape, utilizing a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time specified by the maker and after that sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper until the joints are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
<p>Remove the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and remove the battery right away. Eliminating the battery rapidly might make the distinction to save your phone.

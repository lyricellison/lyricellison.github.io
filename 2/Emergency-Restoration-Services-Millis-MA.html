<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

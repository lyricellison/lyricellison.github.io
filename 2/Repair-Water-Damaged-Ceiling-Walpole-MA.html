<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (often two times a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were really helpful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster.

<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is an extreme, destructive chemical.

For these reasons attempt to prevent using bleach and if you should utilize it, just utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>

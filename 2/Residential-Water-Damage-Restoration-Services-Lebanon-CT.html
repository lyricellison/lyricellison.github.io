<h3>Professional Fire Restoration in Lebanon</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and need to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

<p>Since typical structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.

There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>

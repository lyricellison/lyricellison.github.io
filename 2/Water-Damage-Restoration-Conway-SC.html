<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken.

Other times, you might observe little signs like coffee-colored spots that may expand in time.</p>

<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Conway</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold professionals usually suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the solution on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush up until the mold vanishes. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly. This might worsen the issue because as you understand - mold loves moist environments.<p>

<p>My store leaks and my siblings automobile was parked while we changed the engine during the hot and damp summer season. Mold was all over the automobile's interior. This stuff here seemed to clean it up perfectly when we were completed. He hasn't had any problems with mild ever since. I would suggest this stuff for your mold problems. It's much better then simply utilizing bleach. And not as poisonous and stinky either.</p>
<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he learnt how much water bill I was paying given that the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Really courteous and easy-going individual.</p>

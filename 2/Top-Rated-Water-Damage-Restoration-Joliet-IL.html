<h2>When You Need to Call a Water Damage Restoration Company in Joliet</h2>

<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. Juice three to 5 lemons and pour over afflicted area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a moist towel. Similar to a few of the above methods, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>

<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal noticeable indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might droop or crumble under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous gypsum material. Other times, you might observe little indications like coffee-colored spots that might expand in time.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was simple: It was a perfect storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege came from pressure to construct much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little government and contractor oversight. Contribute to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the average annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>

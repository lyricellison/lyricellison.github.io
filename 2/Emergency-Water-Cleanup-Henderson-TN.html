<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens. Experts have identified Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has affected sprawling rural houses, starter houses, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties built with products other than stucco had problems, too. Some houses with water damage were built by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local companies. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>As a naturally happening and pervasive substance in our world, mold exists in a variety of different forms-- many of which are non-toxic and generally impact those with allergies and asthma. Black mold, specifically, however, is a more serious transgressor. Direct exposure to the poisonous variety of Stachybotrys chartarum can trigger respiratory problems ranging from moderate to severe. It, like the majority of kinds of mold, grows at an alarming rate in the ideal conditions-- specifically in places with prolonged direct exposure to moisture and humidity, such as basements, restrooms, under-sink cabinets, or recently flooded areas. For this reason, property owners must act at first sign of it, and find out how to get rid of black mold before it changes from a benign gamer to an invasive species.</p>

<p>Vapor pressure is directly related to humidity ratio (specific humidity or grains per pound-gpp and dew point). As heat is applied to a material, energy is included. Raising the temperature level of a wet material increases the rate of evaporation, more launching moisture from the material and changing the internal vapor pressure. The higher the difference in between ambient temperature and humidity temperature level, the higher the capacity for faster and more effective drying.</p>

These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of a number of days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>

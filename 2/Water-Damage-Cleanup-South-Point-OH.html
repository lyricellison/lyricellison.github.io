<p>Any building that has actually experienced water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Wear a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore defense, and cover hands, arms and legs to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate noticeable mold. If the moldy location is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will reduce the incidence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use industrial black mold removal items, which can be found in most hardware or home repair stores, to sanitize the moldy areas, in addition to any adjacent locations. If you use bleach, make certain it will not blemish the material or surface area. Place all sponges, equipment and other products utilized in cleaning in a sturdy trash can, and if possible, remove the bag through a close-by exit instead of the main home, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>

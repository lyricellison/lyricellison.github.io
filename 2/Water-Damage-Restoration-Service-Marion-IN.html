<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements.

<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Basking Ridge</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts generally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush until the mold disappears. There's no need to wash it off since borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such materials take in water easily. This could intensify the issue since as you know - mold loves wet environments.<p>

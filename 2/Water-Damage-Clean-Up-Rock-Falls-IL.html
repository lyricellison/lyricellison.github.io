<p>Learn how to remove black mold securely and effectively. Category 3 - Classification 3 water is grossly contaminated and can contain pathogenic, toxigenic, or other hazardous agents. Examples of Category 3 water can include, but are not restricted to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap despite noticeable content or color; all types of flooding from seawater; ground surface area water and increasing water from rivers or streams; and other contaminated water entering or impacting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from hurricanes, tropical storms, or other weather associated occasions.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>

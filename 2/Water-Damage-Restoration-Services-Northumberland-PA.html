<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

Colby and Caleb arrived on the scene within a number of hours and continued to drain pipes the location prior to any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and installed brand-new insulation in the area. They provided excellent, efficient, and expert service in addition to being friendly and pleasant to work with.

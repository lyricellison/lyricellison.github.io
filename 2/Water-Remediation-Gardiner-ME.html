It is important to rapidly control the moisture in the air and use enough airflow to dry the surface of materials to reduce water activity, thus decreasing the capacity for microbial growth. If the surfaces of hygroscopic materials can be dried and kept below 0.75, microbial development can be rapidly stopped, despite the fact that the core of the material may still have elevated wetness content.</p>

<h3>Fire Restoration Experts in Gardiner</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold specialists typically advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area. To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush until the mold disappears. There's no requirement to rinse it off because borax will keep the mold from coming back. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials take in water quickly. This could exacerbate the issue because as you know - mold enjoys wet environments.<p>

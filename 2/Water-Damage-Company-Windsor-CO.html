<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold specialists normally advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the service on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. There's no requirement to wash it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly. This might worsen the problem since as you know - mold enjoys wet environments.<p>

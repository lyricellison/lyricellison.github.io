<p>There are three basic actions to the water damage restoration process. The initial step is to eliminate all of the water from the impacted residential or commercial property. That suggests remedying any pipes issues, repairing any issues that might be triggering condensation, or waiting on the floodwaters to decline, depending on the situations. After the issue has been corrected, the residential or commercial property then needs to be completely dried, removing all traces of wetness.</p>
<p>Completely shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating solution, then spray the afflicted area so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle repeatedly throughout this process in order to guarantee the option stays well mixed.)

Never ever scrape dried mold, otherwise the poisonous spores could spread into air and cause negative health results.</p>

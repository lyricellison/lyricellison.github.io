<p>Mold can trigger severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), likewise often referred to as mildew, is a fungal development that develops on wet products. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a fundamental part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; inside your home, mold development should be prevented. Mold recreate by ways of tiny spores. The spores resemble seeds, but invisible to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surface areas. When the temperature, moisture, and readily available nutrient conditions are appropriate, the spores can form into new mold nests where they are deposited. 1 There are many kinds of mold, however all require wetness and a food source for growth.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide kills mold as it is anti-fungal in addition to anti-viral and anti-bacterial. Hydrogen peroxide is a great alternative to chlorine bleach due to the fact that it is safe to use and doesn't damage the environment, nor does it leave behind toxic residue or produce poisonous fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can buy hydrogen peroxide from drug stores for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>

<p>Also, since bleach is mostly water, on porous surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly absorbed by the product. So, while you may have wiped off or blemished the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact offered a lot of water to regrow and potentially spread the mold below the surface area. If there is a lot of mold growth, seek advice from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  variations of these and other guidance files are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the musty material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement may be needed.<p>

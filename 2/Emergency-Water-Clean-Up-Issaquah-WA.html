<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job properly.

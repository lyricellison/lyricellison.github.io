<p>Current Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he learnt how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning!

<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens. Juice 3 to five lemons and put over afflicted area. Let it sit for five minutes, and after that wipe it away with a damp towel. As with a few of the above approaches, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

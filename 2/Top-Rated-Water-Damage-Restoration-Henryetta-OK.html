<p>Since typical structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

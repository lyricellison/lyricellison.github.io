<p>It's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of up to 18 inches of drywall due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a major health risk. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with complete sheets.

If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and need to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>

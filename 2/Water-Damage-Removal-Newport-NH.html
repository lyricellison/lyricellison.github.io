<p>Recent Evaluation: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the place of the leak for me and then even assisted me closed down my main water valve. Very courteous and easy-going person.</p>

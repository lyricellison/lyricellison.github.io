<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and must be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>Reduce cleanup and drying time with special equipment. Taking immediate action is essential to restoring your residential or commercial property to pre-storm condition when you are dealing with water, storm, and flood damage. Choose the company with the proper storm damage restoration techniques and specific equipment required to manage the task. Black mold is thought about extremely harmful, forming in moist or wet locations and eating natural materials such as wood, drywall, insulation and carpet.<p>

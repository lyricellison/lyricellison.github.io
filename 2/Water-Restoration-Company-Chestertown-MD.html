Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have ended up being contaminated with molds.

The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days.

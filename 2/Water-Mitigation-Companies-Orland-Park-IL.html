<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is in fact made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will include browsing a broad location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

The charge is around $75 per hour if the company charges a hourly rate for water damage restoration services. Unique scenarios, such as debris removal, increase the typical labor rate with additional charges of $200 or more.</p>

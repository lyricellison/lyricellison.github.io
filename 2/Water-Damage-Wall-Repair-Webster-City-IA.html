<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As mentioned, rapid air motion throughout wet surfaces of assemblies or materials is a critical element of efficiently and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or materials. Fast air movement across the surface area of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area moisture paves the way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying products need different criteria for changing conditions.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to preserve the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can purchase devices to measure relative humidity at some home supply shops.

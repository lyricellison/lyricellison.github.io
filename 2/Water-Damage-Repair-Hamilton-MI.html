To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the option on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush till the mold vanishes. There's no need to rinse it off due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall.

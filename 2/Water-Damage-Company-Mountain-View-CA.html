<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, but it can take place by itself if a fire is consisted of. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier produces the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers take in moisture through chemical attraction instead of condensation to remove water from the air. A desiccant is a material that holds and draws in moisture. This material acts like a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through warmed exhaust air, the moisture vaporizes (desorption) and is brought outdoors. Then the cycle repeats.</p>

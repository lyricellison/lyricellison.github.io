<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens.

Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a major health danger.

As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying considering that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going person.</p>

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

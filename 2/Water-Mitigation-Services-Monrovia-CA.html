<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>They called me early morning and asked me for assistance. I showed up to access the situation and found the water was going through the floor to the downstairs ceilings and all the drywall was damaged. To add to the issue, we had actually insulated all the floors and interior walls for sound absorption. All had to be removed and reinstalled throughout the home. We also installed portable heating fans to accelerate the drying process.</p>
<h3>Damage Restoration in Monrovia California</h2>
<p>Mold in the basement can be consistent, given the nature of basements - they tend to be a lot more humid than above-ground levels and typically have bad ventilation and little air circulation, a mix that can trigger mold to grow. And obviously, basements can be prone to flooding, due to severe weather condition or undetected leakages in the pipes or sump pump. In addition, once mold establishes, cinder block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>

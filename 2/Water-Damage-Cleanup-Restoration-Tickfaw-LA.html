<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find visible mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green).

Search for signs of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water stains, condensation, etc.).</p>

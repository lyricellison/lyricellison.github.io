<p>Any building that has suffered from water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water direct exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on walls and floors is another potential effect of water damage. Walls and flooring might require replacement or refinishing depending on the level of damage. Moldy odors can remain in a home where leakages or flooding have occurred and this might be a sign of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>The very best remediation is done by a mold assessor who verifies the existence of a mold problem needing action and the level of damage then writes a clear scope of work including relevant requirements. This document should clearly describe the steps that will be followed by the remediation specialist, for instance how the affected area will be contained or what the verification criteria are. Without a clear contract in composing the conclusions, information, measurements are left to the analysis of each party.</p>

This process takes in moisture without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can easily run below freezing temperature levels.</p>

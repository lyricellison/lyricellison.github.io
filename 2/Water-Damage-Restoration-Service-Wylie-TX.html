<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or business is among the most devastating things that can occur to an individual or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being completely replaced. If there is minor damage then the majority of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might need repairing. Nevertheless, if the damage is major then the whole floor might require replacing and often even the subfloor too. The kind of wood floor covering you may have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Strong hardwood floor covering allows for a larger variety of choices to fix the issue. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area.

<h3>Fire and Smoke Damage Restoration in Wylie</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts typically suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area.

Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water easily. This might exacerbate the issue due to the fact that as you know - mold enjoys moist environments.<p>

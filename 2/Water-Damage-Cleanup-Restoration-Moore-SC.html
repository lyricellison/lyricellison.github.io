<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Negative air machines, geared up with HEPA (high performance particulate air filters") ought to be made use of to eliminate bacteria and other pollutants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage need to be extracted with self-contained vacuum devices with appropriate waste holding tanks which need to be disposed of properly. Difficult surface areas that are affected need to be cleaned and sterilized. Soft structural products such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard must be removed and appropriately dealt with. Any product that absorbs considerable quantities of wetness and can not be effectively cleaned need to be removed. Once contaminated products have been eliminated, a 2nd application of sanitizers must be used to all work surfaces.</p>

<h3>Fire Damage Clean Up in Newtown</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repair work, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it's important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists strengthen the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is finished.<p>

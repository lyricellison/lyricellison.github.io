As soon as MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working.

This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight if this rust procedure is not stopped.</p>

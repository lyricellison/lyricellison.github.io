There is no reliable timetable for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal components typically start rusting instantly after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of a problem. How quickly the rust procedure takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and for how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid.

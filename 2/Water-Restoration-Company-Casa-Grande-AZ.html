<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

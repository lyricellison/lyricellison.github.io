This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very pricey paperweight.</p>

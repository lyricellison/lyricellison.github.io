Did you understand that smoke is in fact made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it simply disappears.

And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.

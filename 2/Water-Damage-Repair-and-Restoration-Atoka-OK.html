<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air till they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>

We will also examine vapor barriers (a sheet or coating that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and eliminate them if they have actually been damaged.</p>

<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

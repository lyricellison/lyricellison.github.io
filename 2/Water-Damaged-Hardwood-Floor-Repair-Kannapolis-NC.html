<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. There is a terrific video below that I motivate you to view. We discovered it while helping a reader with a Recreational Vehicle water damage repair. Not just does it do a terrific job of revealing you the damage that water can do to a Recreational Vehicle, the developer also shows how to repair the damage step by step.

<p>Because common building products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<h2>Effects of Water Damage in Giddings</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Eliminate the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and remove the battery immediately. Getting rid of the battery quickly could make the difference to conserve your phone. Most phones have a white indicator near the battery that will turn red or pink if water has actually damaged the gadget. You can try to draw the wetness out by immersing the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent material over night. You can also attempt to dry it out with a vacuum cleaner, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near to the device. Often cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has actually not been exposed to water long.</p>

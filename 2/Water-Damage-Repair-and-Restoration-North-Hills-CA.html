<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the very same method, so if the place the spores land is good and moist, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Before your house has dried out, scrub floors and woodwork with a stiff brush, plenty of water, a detergent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by polluted floodwater must be removed and discarded unless it can be sanitized at a commercial center for a cost considerably less than replacement. Vinyl flooring and floor tile may need to be gotten rid of to enable drying of subfloor.</p>

<p>These aspects influence the movement of moisture within a material along with the evaporation rate from the surface area of the material and can considerably impact the general drying. time for a project. It is important to quickly manage the wetness in the air and use sufficient airflow to dry the surface area of materials to lower water activity, therefore lowering the capacity for microbial growth.

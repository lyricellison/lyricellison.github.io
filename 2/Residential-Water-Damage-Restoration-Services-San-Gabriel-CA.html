<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air till they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is good and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>

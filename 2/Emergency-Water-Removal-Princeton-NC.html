We know precisely what you are experiencing as we also have conquered water damage from a flooded basement in our home. Our experience has actually altered our lives forever. Our homes are our safe place. Home is where we raise our households, get together for vacations, and where we relax, unwind, and locked out the busyness of daily life.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>

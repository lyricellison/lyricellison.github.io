<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly harmful. We engaged a group of researchers at the University of Colorado as soon as InstaScope was developed. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide acknowledged expert on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was designated to validate and check the brand-new innovation. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to produce a new mold-assessment system for commercial customers that, unlike any other approach or device, can deliver scientifically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so quickly. So when you consider all the threats of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>

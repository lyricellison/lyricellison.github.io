<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he found out just how much water costs I was paying given that the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve.

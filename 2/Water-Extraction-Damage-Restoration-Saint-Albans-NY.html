The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying devices or techniques will be the most efficient. It is essential to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and sensible energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building materials and how they react to each one and supply the best evaporation outcomes. The greater the number, the faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>

<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Black mold can be dangerous to your health, primarily causing respiratory concerns. However in extreme cases and for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you believe a mold invasion, you might wish to buy a mold screening kit to see what kind of mold spores you're dealing with, and employ a specialist to help with removal.

<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold development. Sagging or moldy walls. Any noteworthy sagging in parts of the walls or ceiling is a sign that you require water damage repair services. Drywall 1 sags when filled with water. Seeing noticeable mold on the walls is another sign, but not everyone notices mold within their homes. Before mold is located, you may smell an unique moldy scent or experience allergic reaction signs due to mold exposure. These smells are particularly pungent in locations like the basement. The nasty odor is similar to the scent of wet, mildewy laundry. Unfortunately, it's not unusual for house owners to mistake mold growth for dirt.</p>
<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

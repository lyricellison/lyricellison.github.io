<p>Smoke damage is a common negative effects of fire damage, but it can happen on its own if a fire is consisted of. It is your obligation to pay the deductible if you make a claim with your provider. It is popular for restoration contractors to collect the deductible up front when work is to start, and we will inform your insurance company in such circumstances. Other times, your deductible might be subtracted" from the last insurance check, in which case you would pay the deductible amount at the end of the project.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

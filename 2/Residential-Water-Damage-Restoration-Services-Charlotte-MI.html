<h2>Water Damage To Hardwood Floors Is Inevitable in Charlotte</h2>

<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is damp and excellent, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>

<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are excellent for drying in tough to reach areas-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more suitable when drying under carpet and padding. Similar to axial fans, centrifugal fans move air across damp surface areas, vaporizing moisture into the air. With using warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, an adequate variety of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>

<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally damaging. We engaged a group of researchers at the University of Colorado as soon as InstaScope was developed. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally recognized expert on the biological elements of air pollution, this team was appointed to validate and evaluate the brand-new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for industrial customers that, unlike any other approach or gadget, can provide scientifically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so instantly. So when you think about all the threats of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
<p>To get rid of mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a big brush, and remember that porous surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall may need to be removed and changed.

Testing for mold might cost as low as $20 for a home set or as much as $500 for expert screening.

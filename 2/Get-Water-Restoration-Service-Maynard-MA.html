This works to have in case the insurance coverage adjuster's quote for coverage is too low, and allows you the opportunity to negotiate with your insurer. As soon as you have agreed on an affordable settlement for the cost of repairs, the insurer will typically send you an advance of about half the payment to start repairs and send you the remainder upon completion, minus the deductible.</p>

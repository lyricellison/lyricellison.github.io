<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are great for drying in tough to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are preferable when drying under carpet and padding.

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the room. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell removed. This process goes on for days.

As soon as MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other parts.

The Apple Watch Series 2 and later on have a comparable issue, although they include a built-in feature that can be toggled to 'eject' the water by playing a specific frequency. The worst issue with mold is that it has the potential to trigger health effects. Mold can activate allergies and even asthma attacks, as some people dislike mold. As mold requires water to grow it is important to avoid moisture and humidity problems in buildings, especially ones affected by water.<p>

<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, but it can occur on its own if a fire is contained. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier develops the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers soak up wetness through chemical attraction rather of condensation to get rid of water from the air. A desiccant is a material that brings in and holds moisture. This material acts like a sponge drawing moisture from the air (sorption). When the wheel turns through warmed exhaust air, the moisture evaporates (desorption) and is brought outdoors.

There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days.

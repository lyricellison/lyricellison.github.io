<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Try to find noticeable mold development (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Search for indications of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water stains, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Water damage develops from damaged pipelines, blocked drains, malfunctioning home appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The proper treatment depends on the nature of the damage.

Initially, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical level of sensitivities especially if utilized in areas that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at removing mold than a moist fabric and a moderate detergent, so we recommend the least harmful alternative.</p>

<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his people were incredible in helping us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (typically twice a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the method and likewise were very handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
<p>What to do when your house floods and you are stuck questioning how to cleanup concrete basement floor after a flood?

<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Step the height and width of the area you're fixing so that you know just how much brand-new wallboard you need. If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a spot to fit, using an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your brand-new panel with the wall studs and then secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power driver. Use joint tape to cover the joints where each panel meets. Then apply joint compound over the tape, utilizing a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time specified by the manufacturer and after that sand the compound with fine-grit sandpaper till the seams are flush with the drywall panels.</p>

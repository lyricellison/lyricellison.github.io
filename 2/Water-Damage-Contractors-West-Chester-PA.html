The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or methods will be the most efficient. It is important to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and reasonable energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly anticipates the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to several structure products and how they respond to each one and offer the best evaporation outcomes. The greater the number, the faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>

<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Black mold can be dangerous to your health, primarily causing breathing issues. However in serious cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can result in pneumonia. When you think a mold invasion, you might wish to buy a mold testing kit to see what type of mold spores you're working with, and employ a professional to help with removal. However in the short-term, here are some natural home solutions (made with things you most likely currently have on-hand) that will help get rid of mold.</p>
<p>In Florida, the assessment and remediation of mold damage need a state license. We have both a license and comprehensive training in finishing these tasks and constantly work towards a restore over replace method.

<p>Completely shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating option, then spray the affected location so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle repeatedly throughout this process in order to make sure the option remains well combined.) Allow the liquid to rest on the mold for 5 to 10 minutes so the anti-bacterial properties have time to overcome the grime. Never scrape dried mold, or else the toxic spores could spread into air and cause negative health impacts.</p>
<p>A good way to prevent mold from growing in your house is to lower humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, examine your home for leakages. If water does enter your home, mop it up rapidly and dry the area.

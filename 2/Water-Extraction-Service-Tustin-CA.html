<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation item that mold experts normally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush up until the mold vanishes. There's no need to wash it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such products take in water quickly.

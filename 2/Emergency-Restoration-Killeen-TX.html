<h3>Fire and Smoke Damage Restoration in Killeen</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. It can be a long-term health danger and should be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>

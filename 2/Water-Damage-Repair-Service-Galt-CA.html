<p>Because one of the significant consequences of flood damage is mold infestation, why you would require Dallas mold removal is. If a house or an organisation property has just recently suffered water damage and for that reason mold growth-- which is a type of fungi-- it can quickly spread throughout the home in 24-48 hours. These spores are tiny in nature and thrive on wetness, spreading into nests that produce allergens and irritants.

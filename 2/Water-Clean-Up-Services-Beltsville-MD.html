<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly harmful. We engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado when InstaScope was created. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally recognized professional on the biological aspects of air contamination, this team was designated to confirm and test the new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to create a new mold-assessment system for business consumers that, unlike any other method or device, can provide clinically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help make sure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>

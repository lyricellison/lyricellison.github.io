<p>Class 3 - greatest quantity of water, evaporation, and absorption. Water invasion where wet, porous materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), textiles) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the area; and where products referred to as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have taken in minimal moisture.</p>

As soon as the drying devices is in location it will be necessary to keep the devices on 24 hours a day until the drying procedure is ended up.
